A\nrecord version cannot be resolved if:\n\nIt is unreleased and the user is a read user\n\nIt has been withdrawn and the user is a read user\n\nIt is hidden by access control\n\nSince version control and access control is intended to allow and restrict access to records\nfor certain groups of users, this method may return different results for different users\ndepending on the configuration of Granta MI.\n\n\n\nadd_items_to_list(record_list, items)\n\nAdd items to a record list.\n\nThis method is available for all supported versions of Granta MI.\n\nPerforms an HTTP request against the Granta MI Server API.\nItems are not validated against existing records on the server or existing items in the\nlist.\n\nParameters\n\nrecord_list\n\nRecordList\n\nRecord list in which items will be added.\n\nitems\n\npython:list of RecordListItem\n\nList of items to add to the record list.\n\nReturns\n\npython:list of RecordListItem\n\nList of items included in the record list.\n\n\n\nremove_items_from_list(record_list, items)\n\nRemove items from a record list.\n\nThis method is available for all supported versions of Granta MI.\n\nPerforms an HTTP request against the Granta MI Server API.\nAttempting to remove items that are not in the list will not result in an error.\n\nParameters\n\nrecord_list\n\nRecordList\n\nRecord list from which items will be removed.\n\nitems\n\npython:list of RecordListItem\n\nList of items to remove from the record list.\n\nReturns\n\npython:list of RecordListItem\n\nList of items included in the record list.\n\n\n\ncreate_list(name, description=None, notes=None, items=None)\n\nCreate a new record list with the provided arguments.\n\nThis method is available for all supported versions of Granta MI.\n\nPerforms an HTTP request against the Granta MI Server API.\n\nParameters\n\nname\n\npython:str\n\nName of the record list.\n\ndescription\n\npython:str or python:None\n\nDescription of the record list.\n\nnotes\n\npython:str or python:None\n\nNotes of the record list.\n\nitems\n\npython:list of RecordListItem or python:None\n\nList of items to add to the record list.\n\nReturns\n\nRecordList\n\nCreated record list details.\n\n\n\ndelete_list(record_list)\n\nDelete a record list.\n\nThis method is available for all supported versions of Granta MI.\n\nPerforms an HTTP request against the Granta MI Server API.\n\nParameters\n\nrecord_list\n\nRecordList\n\nRecord list to delete.\n\n\n\nupdate_list(record_list, *, name='_ArgNotProvided', description='_ArgNotProvided', notes='_ArgNotProvided')\n\nUpdate a record list with the provided arguments.\n\nThis method is available for all supported versions of Granta MI.\n\nPerforms an HTTP request against the Granta MI Server API.\n\nParameters\n\nrecord_list\n\nRecordList\n\nRecord list to update.\n\nname\n\npython:str, optional\n\nNew value for the name of the record list.\n\ndescription\n\npython:str or python:None, optional\n\nNew value for the description of the record list.
